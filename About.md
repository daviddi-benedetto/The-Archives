## About
[[Home| The Archives]] is built to last. This means that these notes need to have zero dependencies and need to be flexible for future computer formats. The solution? Markdown.

Every individual page of The Archives is actually just a markdown files (.md) that can be read in any text editor. I use Obsidian to edit and publish these files to the web, but the files themselves are completely independent of any platform and are backed up in various places. This makes it such that if Obsidian, Windows, or any of the platforms I use to backup my files ever go out of business, this collection of notes will still be salvageable for future reading.

### Obsidian
I use the latest version of Obsidian, a free markdown editor, that can be found at their official website at https://obsidian.md/. For hosting, I also using Obsidian Publish, though I am considering self-hosting in the future. I use the *Typomagical* theme (https://github.com/hungsu/typomagical-obsidian) theme with a custom [[00 The Archives Branding/Publish.css|Publish.css]] file for my personal branding and styles.
