### Introduction
Welcome to *The Archives*. This is a quiet place, meant to be experienced fully and slowly. There is no rush here, just the mindful ambiance that comes with learning, writing, and reading. There is also no particular order or direction to these pages, and they are meant to be that way. Here, abstract thinking is interconnected to create a beautiful web of knowledge.

I am [[David Di-Benedetto]], the creator of this unique corner on the internet. As an engineer with a passion for a myriad of subjects, I often find myself lost in the vast sea of information that each new project brings. *The Archives* is my endeavor to anchor my work and insights into a single, documented haven. It's akin to a *second brain* or a *digital garden* - a repository of my intellectual pursuits and findings.

This project draws its muse from the enigmatic library featured in Patrick Rothfuss' *Kingkiller Chronicle* In this series, there exists a vast library aptly named *The Archives*. It is a labyrinthine world of knowledge, housing an immense collection of books, scrolls, and papers in a section known as The Stacks, where organization gives way to a raw accumulation of wisdom.

Mirroring this concept, this project prioritizes the organic aggregation of information. Just as The Stacks in Rothfuss' universe symbolize the untamed and sprawling expanse of knowledge, this platform endeavors to embrace the richness of information in its most authentic form. I aspire to create a digital space that captures the essence of *The Archives* â€“ a sanctuary for knowledge that feels boundless.
