## Planr - Branding
The app is posed towards being simple and minimalistic. *Planr* is meant to be lightweight. Similarly, I want this app to one day be finished, so I tried to not delve too much into the weeds of the branding and instead focus my attention towards creating a finished product.

### Name Choice
The name *Planr* is intuitive enough, but it wasn't the original name for this app. Prior to the switch, the original prototyping I made were hailed under the name *rePlanner*, with the "re" standing for "redesigned". I ended up siding towards the name *Planr* in the end because of its simplicity and memorability.

### Logo Design
I wish I could say that there was a lot of thought put into creating the logo for *Planr*, but similar to its naming, I decided simpler is better. I originally was leaning on the star as the centerpiece of the logo before I started filling in the empty space inside the letters, which I decided were a unique touch to make the app stand out.
